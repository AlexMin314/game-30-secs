## Stack
* Javascript, HTML5(no canvas), CSS3

## How to play
* Dodge the dots.
* Capture the stars.
* Keep yourself away from the laser.
* Move your red dot using a mouse.
* Pause the game with spacebar. (3 times limit)

## Play Tips
* Surviving is a priority than capturing the stars. The star-spawn is 2 max. No need to rush.
* Use game pause(spacebar) when you have a problem. (3 times limit)
* The game pause makes you easy to find escaping path or stops your red dot before colliding into an enemy.

## Patch Note (04/06/2017)
* Automatically adjusting game difficulty based on the width of the browser.
* Now, more dots spawn in the bigger screen.
* The dots velocity slightly decreased.
* Every 60 Sec, 1 more dot will be spawned.
* The dots which are newly spawned have slightly more velocity than initial spawn. (checking every 30 secs)
